Background
----------

Dog waste is a significant problem in the UK. There are approximately 8.5 million dogs in the country with roughly
25% of all households currently owning a dog. And with each dog needing to defecate up to 5 times every day that 
could mean a staggering 42.5 million dog poops per day that need to be dealt with.

Many dog owners are responsible and clean up after their pooch but we all know that too many are not as socially
responsible, leading to the pollution of environments that are there for all us to enjoy and share. Not only an
inconvenience, dog poo also poses substantial health risks to humans (particular young children) and other animals
including commercially important livestock.

Summary
-------

This application is Pooper snooper - a cross platform mobile application that is currently being built on ionic. 

The main functionality of the app is to allow people to locate dog bins and record/report dog waste incidents in the country.
We also want this app to provide essential information in order to improve awareness of the issues of dog waste which will
encourage dog owners to be more socially responsible and mitigate the issues of dog waste.
