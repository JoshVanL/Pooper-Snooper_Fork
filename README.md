Software project engineering 2016/2017 - Pooper snooper

Background
----------

Dog waste is a significant problem in the UK. There are approximately 8.5 million dogs in the country with roughly
25% of all households currently owning a dog. And with each dog needing to defecate up to 5 times every day that 
could mean a staggering 42.5 million dog poops per day that need to be dealt with.

Many dog owners are responsible and clean up after their pooch but we all know that too many are not as socially
responsible, leading to the pollution of environments that are there for all us to enjoy and share. Not only an
inconvenience, dog poo also poses substantial health risks to humans (particular young children) and other animals
including commercially important livestock.

Summary
-------

This application is Pooper snooper - a cross platform mobile application that is currently being built on ionic. 

The main functionality of the app is to allow people to locate dog bins and record/report dog waste incidents in the country.
We also want this app to provide essential information in order to improve awareness of the issues of dog waste which will
encourage dog owners to be more socially responsible and mitigate the issues of dog waste.

Planned Features
----------------

1-Smartphone GPS locating Similar to Google Maps. We will provide all recorded dog bins throughout the country on our app home page, represented by a map. Once users spot a dog bin which is not part of our database (not marked on the map), they can submit a request to have it added. Once the bin in question can be verified we can simply add this it to our database. Future usability GPS functionality, users may be able to report litter findings at their location which will be forwarded to the city council. Beyond that users are rewarded if they can publish dog waste they submit on to the app. Furthermore, we are progressing on development of a distance calculator from user's position to the nearest dog bins.

2-Social media Interface. We support and encourage users to share their doggy findings with their community in social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Users may even be able to log in with their Facebook or Twitter account if they want, instead of registering. A chat room or a message board may be set in the future to facilitate communication between users. Users can comment on the published photos of dog waste or dog bins as well, which is one of our validating methods because some people may upload some fake photos. There are two buttons shown in the menu when users click on one photo, one is approve, and another is disapprove, they can click the button and leave their opinion about this photo whether it is valid or not. 3-Reward system In order to encourage the user to continuously engage with the app, we need to ensure the user is rewarded for each positive action they performed. One of the methods is by introducing a points and achievements system. By granting user "points", this indicates to the user how much they have influenced the local environment.

Furthermore, a leaderboard will be introduced into our system which corresponds to the user's "points". There are two types that we can implement, one of them is a local leader board, where the user can check their progress against their friends which corresponds to our social media interface, we will also implement a global leader board.
